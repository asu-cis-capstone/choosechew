Our ChooseChew app is an app that aims to help hungry, indecisive users decide on a place to eat at. The app can randomly generate a nearby restaurant using the user's GPS location. The app will also have the option available for the user to login and create a Favorites list that will automatically be saved to the user's account. If the user so chooses, the app can also randomly select a restaurant only from his/her Favorites list.
